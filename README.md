<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

## 📖 TDD project <a name="about-project"></a>

The Test-Driven Development (TDD) Project is a hands-on exercise in implementing the principles of TDD using Ruby. The project involves creating a Solver class with methods such as factorial, reverse, and fizzbuzz, with the unique aspect being that tests are written before the code. This project serves as a practical experience in writing tests first and then developing software that passes these tests, adhering to best practices for Ruby and professional documentation.

<!-- Features -->

### Key Feature <a name="key-features"></a>

- **Test-Driven Development:** This project is built using the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD), ensuring robust and reliable code.
- **Solver Class:** The Solver class includes methods for common operations such as factorial calculation, string reversal, and the FizzBuzz problem.
- **Factorial Method:** The factorial method calculates the factorial of a number, handling edge cases such as negative numbers and zero.
- **Reverse Method:** The reverse method takes a string and returns it reversed, providing a handy utility for string manipulation.
- **FizzBuzz Method:** The fizzbuzz method implements the popular FizzBuzz problem, returning ‘fizz’, ‘buzz’, ‘fizzbuzz’, or the number itself based on the input.
- **Error Handling:** The project includes error handling for invalid inputs, raising exceptions where appropriate.
Comprehensive Testing: Each method in the Solver class has corresponding tests, ensuring that all functionalities work as expected.
- **Best Practices:** The project follows best practices for Ruby, including consistent naming conventions, clear code comments, and proper use of data structures.
